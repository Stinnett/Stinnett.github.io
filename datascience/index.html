		<div class="datascience">
			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>To teach myself some data science and programming skills, I've spent my "free time" working on this loan data project (shh, don't tell my advisor that I know what free time is).</p>
			
			<p> Over the past several years, multiple websites have built platforms to enable the crowdfunding of personal loans (as well as business loans, home mortgages, etc).  These sites are providing two services; first, they provide funds for some personal or business endeavor, often at a lower interest/fee rate than would be available through a traditional lending institution.  Second, they give investors a new place for their money, potentially outperforming average stock market return. </p>
			
			<p> These sites provide much information about the loan applicant to the investor so that they can make informed decisions on their investments.  While much of the information provided is the same between these sites (e.g. reported income, occupation, homeownership, credit score, etc), there are differences in the information provided.  For example, Prospect gives investors the full credit underwriting report, for a total of over 500 columns of data per loan, while Lending Club provides less than 40 data points. </p>
			
			<p> All of this raises many questions.  </p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>How well can I predict if a loan will be good (paid off fully and on time) vs bad (defaults or is charged off)? </li>
			  <li> If I can predict loans well, what are my expected returns for a given investment strategy?</li>
			  <li>What variables are the best predictors of loan quality? </li>
        		  <li>Can I make better investment decisions on one site vs another by leveraging the extra information?</li>
      			  </ul> 
      
      			<p> These are all questions that are academically interesting to me, but they are of enormous use to investors, who want to profit, and to the websites, as they are competing businesses and want to provide the best platform possible. </p>
      
      			<p> To explore these questions, I have acquired datasets from two of these personal loan sites (Prospect and Lending Club).  After data cleaning and some data exploration, I have been applying different machine learning techniques to perform loan outcome predictions.  Demos will be shown here on the Lending Club dataset, for now. </p>
      			
      			<p><strong>Major disclaimer:</strong> The ML methods used here are potentially useful, but have a fundamental flaw.  These models assume that the risks of these loans are static (no temporal component to any effects) and are ONLY based on the loan information.  If there was an economic crash or other major event, loans may be significantly more likely to default.  These factors would be considered by a credit rating agency like Standard & Poor's.  These factors should be strongly considered by investors, but are beyond the scope of this project.  I am interested in eventually learning how to start accounting for these factors, but currently I am focused on exploring machine learning and data science techniques. </p>
