					<h2>Selected Research Projects</h2>
					
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Isotope Identification:</strong>(@UIUC) Developed isotope identification algorithms for low-resolution detectors for dissertation project. </li>
						<li><strong>Data Science:</strong>(@home) Tested various machine learning classification techniques on large peer-to-peer personal loan data to evaluate individual loans as an investment opportunity.  See the data science link at the top of the page. </li>
						<li><strong>Neural networks:</strong> (@UIUC) Wrote various neural network training routines in MATLAB and used NNs to classify gamma-ray spectra as a proof of concept/feasability.  Project is being pursued by another grad student for thesis reseearch.</li>
						<li><strong>Nuclear isotope libraries:</strong> (@UIUC) Developed a method to generate custom isotope libraries for radiation detectors.  One problem for peak-based isotope identification on low-resolution detectors is that many photopeaks are not resolvable due to overlap with other peaks or because they are simply too small.  This library generation algorithm couples an arbitrary peak detection method and information about the detector to generate a reduced set of peak information, making peak-based identification more feasible for these detectors. </li>
						<li><strong>Molecular spectroscopy:</strong> (@OU) Working with Dr. Shafer-Ray, I performed calculations and simulations of an NO-He van der Waals complex to explain an experimental observation of a linear Stark effect. </li>
